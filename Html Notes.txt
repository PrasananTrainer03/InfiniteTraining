Web Applications :

These are the applications that which are to be called from various
places rather than where they are created. 

If you want to make any distribute or robust applications, then we need
the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 


	(i) Scripting Languages

	(ii) Programming Langauges 

Difference between scripting and programming languages : 
__________________________________________________________


	Scripting languages are languages that which are interpreted, 
during runtime they takes lot of time to execute. 

	Programming languages are languages that which are compiled first, 
	during runtime they takes very less time to execute. 

In Web applications, we can implement both client-side/server-side scripting

Client-Side Scripting : 
________________________

	-> Enables you to access the application from the client system

	-> No Network traffic

	-> Execution will be faster 

Server-Side Scripting : 

	-> Enables you to access the application from the server

	-> Network traffic is high

	-> A bit slower. 

*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No Security, please opt for client-side scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. Min. security, please opt for both client-side/server-side scripting ***
*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High security please opt for server-side scripting ***
